  </p> VISION AND BACKGROUND
  The Saint Nicholas Houses is a New York City Housing Authority development located in
  Central Harlem between 127th and 131st Streets, North to South, 7th Avenue and Frederick
  Douglass Avenue, East to West - just a few blocks from the historic Apollo Theater. Built under
  Title of the 1949 Federal Housing Act (also known as the Slum Clearance and Community
  Development and Redevelopment Act), the development is composed of 13 buildings, each
  building 14-stories and home to a total of 1,526 apartments. The development is located in a
  vibrant and rapidly changing community. St. Nicholas Houses currently has a population of
  3,525 residents of which 60.5% identify as African American and 35.5% as Hispanic. While this
  diversity is a source of strength, the changes that are occuring on the peripheral space that
  surrounds St. Nicholas, are also playing themselves out on the campus in a more granular
  fashion.</p>
  </p>Currently, Saint Nicholas residents are emotionally and mentally attempting to reconcile the
  experience of decaying public housing infrastructure alongside hyper-gentrification. The influx of
  more affluent residents has increased the cost of living in surrounding areas and heightened
  feelings of isolation and income insecurity. These factors coupled with systemic divestment in
  low- and middle-income safety nets, including public housing, have created conditions of
  poverty that correlate with deteriorating perceptions of public safety, and social cohesion and
  collective efficacy. </p>
  </p>According to the 2015 DOH Community Health profile 39% of adults have college degrees, but
  one in five adults have not completed high school in Central Harlem. Over one in ten Central
  Harlem adults ages 16 and older is unemployed and nearly half of residents spend more than
  30% of their monthly gross income on rent'. This pressure on people's income has a particularly
  insidious impact on youth,whose immediate access to employment in the surrounding area is in
  the service industry, namely retail, which provides little around the area of professional
  development. Institutions like Harlem Children's Zone have played a great role in reversing
  negative trends of youth unemployment and educational equity, in central harlem in particular,where the out of school and work age group (18-24) drop from 36 to 22% ". While there has
  been a moderate level of success in addressing these systemic problems. In St. Nicholas
  houses the sentiments amongst the older residents is that youth, with particular focus on
  employability is a key concern.</p>

  </p>The Neighborhood Stat (Stat) 25 member team represents a cross-section of intergenerational
Saint Nicholas Houses residents, city agencies and community-based organizations. The NStat
Team is pleased to submit this action plan, which aims to serve disengaged youth ages 14-24 in
educational, personal and professional development activities. This project specifically targets
young people who are congregating in areas adjacent to buildings 250 and 260 along West
131st Street. One of the primary concerns identified by residents of the St. Nicholas House is
youth engagement; specific to their concern is how to best integrate young people into the
larger structure of the community like community board meetings, participatory budgeting and
build the block meetings all having material importance in the trajectory of the community. </p>
  </p>Currently, 41.8% of the campus is under the age of 25. This data indicates a high concentration
of young people, so youth development would naturally be the heart of any plan aimed at
improving community efficacy and considering that the unemployment rate for central harlem, is
double the city average; it was noted in a study conducted around NYCHA communities, that
those NYCHA campuses that are facing rapid gentrification are not benefiting from the increase
in the private amenities that come along with a change in the social support system.</p>
  </p>The NStat team stressed the need for specific space dedicated to the youth and the importance
of intergenerational connection. Under this thematic, the residents envisions the creation of a
youth hub. The "St. Nick Youth Engagement & Career Development Hub project and the St.
Nicholas Houses NStat Team, as the stewards of the hub, will engage St. Nicholas Houses
youth around the themes of employment, economic mobility, and community cohesion and
collective efficacy, Specifically, the HUB will act as both a place to test new and innovative ways
of engaging youth by focusing on user generated content, and supplementing traditional
programs available through institutions like the Harlem Children's Zone. The Team will engage
youth in civic action while teaching job skills and the importance of collective power. As
secondary goals, the NStat Team aims to dismantle intergenerational barriers and preserve
neighborhood history, ensure young people can participate in the local economy, and reach their
personal potential. These goals are critical for preventing the loss community culture and
ensuring the economic viability of existing residents and future generations of residents.</p>
